<h1 align="left">Project Description</h1>

<p align="left">Project AIZO is a console application for generating, sorting, and managing arrays of various data types. The application allows generating arrays with random, sorted, reversed, and partially sorted values. Supported data types are int, float, char, and double. The program offers various sorting algorithms such as QuickSort, ShellSort, HeapSort, and InsertionSort.</p>

<h2 align="left">Features</h2>

<p align="left"> <b>Array Generation</b>: Ability to generate arrays with random values, sorted values, reversed values, and partially sorted values.
  
<b>Sorting</b>: Implementation of various sorting algorithms, such as QuickSort, ShellSort, HeapSort, and InsertionSort.

<b>Sort Checking</b> A function to check if an array is sorted.

<b>Saving and Loading Data</b> Ability to save generated or sorted arrays to files and load arrays from files.

<b>Support for Various Data Types</b> The application supports four data types: int, float, char, and double.</p>

<h2 align="left">Example Usage</h2>
<b>Generating Arrays: </b>

<p align="left">In the main menu, select the option "Generate arrays with random values in a new text file" to generate a new array. You can choose the type of array (random, sorted, reversed, partially sorted), data type (int, float, char, double), and the size of the array.</p>
<b>Sorting Arrays: </b>

<p align="left">Select the sorting option from the available algorithms in the sorting menu. After choosing an algorithm, the array will be sorted and saved to a file. In the case of QuickSort, you will have the option to choose the type of pivot (left, middle, right, random).</p>
<b>Checking Sort: </b>

<p align="left">Use the checking function to ensure that the array is sorted correctly.</p>
